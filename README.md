### Product Description
This application will inform students of what goes on in the university and inform them when they will be occurring. The application will present different tasks, each with its own objectives. As students complete these objectives they will be rewarded with badges which will encourage students to participate and reap the benefits of the resources and opportunities the university provides to the students.

A rough visualization of the product is as follows:
A miniature avatar running across a real-time calendar filled with actual events and available resources. While the avatar is on the relevant day, the user is able to “complete” the task in app earning badges and achievements. By doing this the user is reminded of the opportunities/resources being available in real life. 
The user will be able to look ahead in the calendar for upcoming events in order to better plan out their week/month.
